    <h1>Joy Edem</h1>
    <p> <em> MLOps Professional </em> <br> <strong> Aspiring Full Stack Engineer </strong> </p>
    <p> I'm a data professional with over 3 years of work experience, currently transitioning more into the software
      engineering space. My expertise and interests includes predictive modelling, creating REST APIs with Python
      (FastAPI), Docker, and
      picking up technologies quickly. On a more personal note, I'm an enthisiast of many things, including but not
      limited to: programming, anime, basketball, and cooking. I love the process of creating something out of an idea -
      whether that be software related, such as fiddling around with pyGame to make a basic 2d game, or dreaming up some
      non-traditional (to me) cuisine and using my Google-fu to find out a recipe and re-create it to my taste. <br>
      Newness, variety is important to my professional life as I love learning, growing, and stretching myself beyond
      the known.
      Outside of work, novelty is not essential for me - I'm very much comfortable with operating under my routine, but
      spicing things up every
      now and then is fun. </p>
