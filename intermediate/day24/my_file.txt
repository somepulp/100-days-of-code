Hello, my name is Joy.
This is why you should close files after opening them in python: 
Once python opens a file, it takes up resources on your computer.
It might free up the resources by closing the file later, but there's no expectation as to when that will happen
To ensure it happens, and free up resources once you're done with the file, you close the file with the file.close() method.
