# This is a method of encoding text, by shifting each letter of the alphabet by a pre-determined amount

#instructions for using: 
# ask user whether they want to 'encode' or 'decode' a message
# ask user to type the message
# print the result of your encryption or decryption
# allow them to continue the program if they choose

# Part 1 - Encryption
# initial ideas:
#- % 26 is essential for shifts > 26
#- while loop - to allow the user ot continue -- while continue = yes.. continue.. 
#- need two alphabets? one is the original, one is the shifted.. they both should have the same length..

alphabet = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n', 'o', 'p', 'q', 'r', 's', 't', 'u', 'v', 'w', 'x', 'y', 'z']

direction = input("Type 'encode' to encrypt, type 'decode' to decrypt:\n")
text = input("Type your message:\n").lower()
shift = int(input("Type the shift number:\n"))

#TODO-1: Create a function called 'encrypt' that takes the 'text' and 'shift' as inputs.

    #TODO-2: Inside the 'encrypt' function, shift each letter of the 'text' forwards in the alphabet by the shift amount and print the encrypted text.  
    #e.g. 
    #plain_text = "hello"
    #shift = 5
    #cipher_text = "mjqqt"
    #print output: "The encoded text is mjqqt"

#TODO-3: Call the encrypt function and pass in the user inputs. You should be able to test the code and encrypt a message.
