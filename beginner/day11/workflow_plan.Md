The goal of blackjack is to get as close to 21 as possible, before the other player, which is often the computer (dealer).

Cards after 10 are considered 10 - i.e. J,Q,K all are seen as summing to 10.
Ace - counts as 1 or 11 - depending on whether you are under 21 or not 
The idea is depending on your current sum, how likely will the next randomized number get you closer to 21, but not over it. 

If you get over 21, you lose
If the other player gets closer to 21 than you, you lose

'Hit' means give another card, and calculate total sum

How the game will work:
1. Ask for user input - to start the game
2. Assign two random cards to the user, and assign one card to the computer
3. allow user to obtain another card, or pass
3a. if they obtain another hand, show the new card in the list, and keep the computer's cards the same - i.e. do not draw another hand for the computer yet
3b. if they pass - end the game by printing our their final hand and also draw final cards for the computer..
4. output the winner:
     - user: if user has higher score less than or equal to 21
     - computer: if user exceeds the total of 21, or computer has higher score
     - draw if computer and dealer have the same final score
