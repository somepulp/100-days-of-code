## Functions

In-built python functions work similarly - inputs go within the parentheses.

To make our own functions we need to use the `def` keyword. Think of this as *def*ining your function. The general structure is below:
```
def function_name():
    do something
```
To call the function, type: `function_name()` - add any necessary inputs within the parentheses. 

Functions give us a way of minimizing repetitive code, or re-using it efficiently. 
Rather than having to type and retype the same set of instructions, turn it into a function! 
Simplify yo life!!

## Indentation 

Indentation is super important in python. Anything idented within the function is considered as a code block, and ran within the function. 

If code is indented at the same level as the function definition, then that piece of code is considered to NOT be within the function. So when the function is called, that piece of code will not be ran. 

Same thing applies, as usual for ifelse statements, loops, etc. 

Note: the official python documentation defines an indent as 4 spaces, so ensure your editor converts tabs to 4 spaces!
